<h2>About me üôã</h2>
<p>I'm a passionate hardcore learner. Currently, I'm channeling my creativity and technical skills into Toolblox Labs (more on that later).

My journey in tech has been driven by a relentless curiosity and a dedication to mastering new skills. I belive that our work is always a reflexion of our determination, determination always surpasses natural talent!
</p>
<h2>What Drives Me? ‚ú®</h2>
<p> I have a deep fascination with Big Tech and the visionary minds that lead these companies. Icons like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk inspire me daily. Their relentless pursuit of innovation and their ability to turn ambitious ideas into reality are qualities I deeply admire and strive to emulate in my own work.
</p>
<h2>What Am I Working On? üßë‚Äçüíª</h2>
<p> Mainly Toolblox Labs and the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, i'm normally working at multiple projects at a time.

<h2>Let's Connect! ü§ù</h2>
